                Llamas are known for getting along with many other animals, especially other herd animals. Llamas may get along well with dogs, too. Apart from being able to fiercely protect sheep and other livestock from predators, llamas can also get along with dogs. Similar to dogs, llamas are domesticated animals that like to spend time with their owners. Llamas can enjoy a dog’s presence and it’s known for these animals to be able to bond well.
