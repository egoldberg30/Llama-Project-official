                <p>It might sound silly, but keep your llamas healthy. No amount of grooming can help an unhealthy llama
                    shine. Feed your llamas a nutritious diet and provide them with proper care. This "grooming from the
                    inside" will go a long way towards having llamas that look good on the outside. Llama grooming is also very important,
                    and it can be a great way to bond with them.</p>
